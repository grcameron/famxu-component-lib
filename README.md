# famxu-component-lib
I'm creating a component library, the intent of which is to be used for an accessibility tracking tool.  Although it could be reused for any dashboard type application.

The key purpose is to run through some UX exercises and prototyping, I plan to create designs and take it through to it's conclusion by creating the user interface.

Finally I will create the back end for this tool.

It should be themable and easily re-used if someone was so inclined.

I'll also create a static web page for publishing my work.
